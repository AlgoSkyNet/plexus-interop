Typical development cycle for integration with Plexus Interop:

frame "Interop Governance Server" {
    [Metadata Registry]
}

frame "Dev Machine" {
    [Local Metadata]
    [Plexus Studio]
    frame "App In Development" as appDev {
        [Client API]
        [App Logic] as App
    }
}

frame "Interop Production Server" {
    [Interop Registry Service]
}

frame "User Machine" {

    [Deployed App]
}

[Metadata Registry] -> [Local Metadata] : 1) Clone existing metadata
[Local Metadata] -> [Local Metadata] : 2) Define metadata
[Local Metadata] -down-> [Client API] : 3) Generate API
[Client API] -> [App] : 4) Integrate API into app
[Client API] <-down-> [Plexus Studio] : 5) Test app via Plexus Studio
[Local Metadata] -up-> [Metadata Registry] : 6) Raise change request
[Approver] -> [Metadata Registry] : 7) Review/approve
[Metadata Registry] ..> [Interop Registry Service] : 8) Promote
appDev ..> [Deployed App] : 9) Deploy app
[Interop Registry Service] -> [Plexus Interop] : 10) Download metadata
[Plexus Interop] .. [Deployed App]

. Clone existing interop API definitions (metadata) from remote central registry
. Define new interop metadata locally
. Generate client interop APIs from local metadata
. Integrate generated interop APIs into the app
. Publish new metadata into local "sandbox" registry
. Test interop flow via Plexus Studio:
.. If app provides service then you can call it from Plexus Studio.
.. If app consumes some service then you can check that app sends correct interop messages into Plexus Studio.
.. Repeat steps 2-5 until you are fully happy with API and its implementation.
. Deploy new version of the app with new interop flow
. Publish interop metadata into central registry for approval
. Once new metadata is approved it should get into central Interop Registry and become available to all users
. Test flow between apps end-to-end in real environment
