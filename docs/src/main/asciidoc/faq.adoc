==== How to add authentication into Plexus?

. Define custom startup step for Plexus. In this step you should produce user identity string (e.g. e-mail) and security token (optional).
// TODO @Andrey add more details on how to register custom step
. Build custom App Launcher. Plexus will pass user identity and any other information captured in custom step into App Launcher. App Launcher can send this information into the app.

==== How to integrate with custom entitlement systems to control who can access the app?

Build custom App Registry that returns different sets of apps in JSON based on user identity provided by Plexus. To enable user identity in Plexus see <<how-to-auth>>.
// TODO @Andrey add more details on how to build custom App Registry
